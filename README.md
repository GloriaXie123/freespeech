# freespeech
This is my personal blog web application, i create this project for the following reasons:

1.i am tired of wechat,blog sina, and other social media that can't guarantee my free speech and random thoughts with fully inner exposure,

so i want to build this anomynous blog.

2.i am on my way to be a software engineer, practice matters, this is a practice.

3.learn by writting, benefit myself and others.
